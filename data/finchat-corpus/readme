TEST SETTING
Participants were given topic on which to have conversation with other participant in the private chat room. Participants did not know who they were speaking with. After each chat session which lasted 10-15 minutes, each participant filled an evaluation form (questionnaire) on the quality of the conversation. Participants had 1-3 conversations.

Before the session, participants were asked not to share personal informations or copyrighted material. The parts of the conversations which did not respect the instructions were removed. This problem occurred mainly with high schoolers.

Some conversations are missing evaluation from metadata or some of the answers are missing or have been answered multiple times.
